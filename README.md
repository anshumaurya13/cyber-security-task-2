while reseraching a phishing email i found somethings lets take a upper phishing email example.
always check the sender email address they are siletly diffrent from the orginal email
copy the header of the email and paste to header analysis , you found more result from header ananlysis
now check the suspicious link about 90% of time there was a link 
alawyas a phishing link use urgent and threatening message 
note the mismatch url
there is a lot of spelling mistake in email (your password hs been changed )
